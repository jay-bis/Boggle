# Boggle
A neat little game of Boggle created as homework for a CS class

This game of Boggle includes a graphical interface created with TKinter.  Boards are randomly generated according to letter weights contained
in a word database/textfile.  Also includes a solve function that will give you every possible word on the current board.
